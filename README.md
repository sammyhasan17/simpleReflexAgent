# simpleReflexAgent
My first simple reflex agent (artificial Intelligence)

After learning about Simple refelx agents in class the professor asked up to think of an example in the real world he gave the exmpale of an email filtering spam. The very first thing I though of an agent like that was a bouncer, filtering people in the line. It was funny to me and later he asked us to build our own, so I just stuck with my idea and built it since it was fun.
